# Roadmap

## Building the Machine Learning Model

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**:
   - Collect a dataset of maize leaf images, including various diseases. Ensure the dataset is well-labeled with the disease names or classes.
   - Preprocess the images (resize, normalize, augment) to make them suitable for training a machine learning model. Tools like OpenCV or PIL in Python can be used for image preprocessing.

2. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - **YOLOv8**: Given your project needs real-time analysis, YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8 is an excellent choice for its speed and accuracy in detecting objects within images. Since you're an expert, you can customize the model architecture based on your dataset's complexity and the computational limitations of the Raspberry Pi.
   - Use a deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow to build and train your model. Both frameworks support YOLOv8 and offer comprehensive tools and libraries for deep learning applications.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split your dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Train your model using the training set, tweaking hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, number of epochs) to improve accuracy. Use the validation set to fine-tune these parameters and prevent overfitting.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set to ensure it generalizes well to new, unseen images.

4. **Model Optimization for Deployment**:
   - Once the model is trained, optimize it for inference on the Raspberry Pi. This might involve quantization (reducing the precision of the weights) and pruning (removing unnecessary weights) to make the model lighter and faster without significantly sacrificing accuracy.
   - Convert the model to a format compatible with TensorFlow Lite, as TFLite models run efficiently on edge devices like the Raspberry Pi.

## Deploying the Model on Raspberry Pi

1. **Setting Up the Raspberry Pi**:
   - Install the necessary libraries and dependencies for running TensorFlow Lite models. Ensure the Raspberry Pi OS and all software packages are up to date.
   - Connect the Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 to the Raspberry Pi and enable the camera interface through the `raspi-config` tool.

2. **Model Deployment**:
   - Transfer the optimized TensorFlow Lite model to the Raspberry Pi.
   - Write a Python script using TensorFlow Lite Interpreter to load the model, capture live images from the camera, and perform inference on these images to classify maize diseases.

3. **Sending Classification Results to a Web App**:
   - Develop a simple web app using Flask or Django (for Python developers) that can receive and display classification results. Your web app will have an endpoint that the Raspberry Pi can send POST requests to, with the classification results as the payload.
   - On the Raspberry Pi, modify your Python script to send HTTP requests to your web app's endpoint, including the disease classification result in each request.

### Building the Web App

1. **Web App Development**:
   - Use Flask or Django to create a web app. Design a simple UI to display the classification results, including the disease name and possibly the confidence score.
   - Implement an API within your web app that can receive data from the Raspberry Pi. Use database models to store received classification results for historical analysis and real-time display.

2. **Visualization and Interaction**:
   - Enhance your web app with features like real-time updates (using AJAX or WebSockets) to dynamically display the latest classification results without needing to refresh the page.
   - Consider adding user authentication, historical data visualization, and the ability to mark false positives/negatives for further model training.
